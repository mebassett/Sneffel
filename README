Dear reader,

I decided to open source Sneffel.  The code is sparsely commented (if at all) and I haven't done any documentation for it.  I decided in Feb put the sourcecode to some of my personal projects on github, and I've not done much to the code to make it friendlier to other programmers or environments.  There's a lot of junk (a lot of unused pages in /view hanging around), and some poor engineering choices (For instance, image and latex cache should be stored in seperate directories.)  So I apologize as you sort through it.  I hope, at least, that my uncommented undocumented code isn't too obsfucated for other programmers to understand.  Just follow the code in each /controller file.  You can see a working example at sneffel.com, of course.  And feel free to email me any questions.

PS there's a lot of code here from other open source projects (e.g jquery).  I apologize for the duplicates!
